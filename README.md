# Newtro’s Multichain Platform: Reclaiming the Artistic Narrative

## The Problem

As we grow, we've identified several key challenges in the web3 art ecosystem:

- Multichain Fragmentation:
Artists’ works are scattered across various blockchains and marketplaces, making it difficult for them to maintain control of their narrative. This fragmentation weakens their presence and obscures the full scope of their artistic journey.

- Limited Discovery Tools:
Marketplaces control the visibility of artworks, often prioritizing corporate interests. This makes it harder for both artists to be discovered and collectors to easily find works across different chains, hindering growth and engagement.

- Closed Protocols with Corporate Agendas:
While platforms claim to be open, many are driven by corporate agendas, confining artists within systems that mimic web2 giants. This undermines the ethos of web3 and limits creative freedom by reducing our practice to simple and ephemeral content sharing.

- Collector Friction:
Collectors face barriers when exploring new markets or chains, from learning new minting processes to managing different wallets. This complexity discourages participation, slowing down the potential for discovery and investment.

## Our Solution

Newtro’s platform is designed specifically around the needs of our artist collective, focusing on a user experience that bridges the gaps between multiple blockchains. Our goal is to empower both artists and collectors by simplifying the creation, discovery, and collection of NFTs, all while preserving the integrity of the onchain art ecosystem.

## Features
For this hackathon, we developed three key features:

- A Minter: This tool simplifies the minting process, allowing artists to create new NFTs effortlessly, without the usual complications. For this case, we are using Zora's open protocol on Arbitrum but in the next few days, we would love to integrate more blockchains and protocols.
- A Visualizer: A comprehensive tool that enables users to explore each artwork's metadata, view its history, and discover other pieces within the collection, all in one place.
- A Frame Generator for Warpcast: This feature allows artists and collectors to share custom frames that showcase specific artworks or entire collections, making it easier to display and trade NFTs directly within the app.
