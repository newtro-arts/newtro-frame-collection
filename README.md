# Newtroâ€™s Multichain Platform: Reclaiming the Artistic Narrative

## Features
For this hackathon, we developed three key features:

- A Minter: This tool simplifies the minting process, allowing artists to create new NFTs effortlessly, without the usual complications. For this case, we are using Zora's open protocol on Arbitrum but in the next few days, we would love to integrate more blockchains and protocols.
- A Visualizer: A comprehensive tool that enables users to explore each artwork's metadata, view its history, and discover other pieces within the collection, all in one place.
- A Frame Generator for Warpcast: This feature allows artists and collectors to share custom frames that showcase specific artworks or entire collections, making it easier to display and trade NFTs directly within the app.
